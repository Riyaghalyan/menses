      <h1>Premenstrual Cramps</h1>
      <p>Premenstrual cramps are a common symptom experienced by many women before the onset of their period. These cramps are caused by the contraction of the uterus, which is preparing to shed its lining.In other words we can say PMS is when a girl has mood and body changes before or during her period. It's usually at its worst during the 4 days before a period. PMS usually goes away 2 to 3 days after the period begins.</p>

      <h2> Menstural Cramps</h2>
       <pre>
        <code>Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) are throbbing or cramping pains in the lower abdomen. Many women have menstrual cramps just before and during their menstrual periods. <br>For some women, the discomfort is merely annoying. For others, menstrual cramps can be severe enough to interfere with everyday activities for a few days every month.<br>Conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids can cause menstrual cramps. Treating the cause is key to reducing the pain. Menstrual cramps that aren't caused by another condition tend to lessen with age and often improve after giving birth.
           <h4>Symptoms</h4><br>1. Throbbing or cramping pain in your lower abdomen that can be intense <br>2. Pain that starts 1 to 3 days before your period, peaks 24 hours after the onset of your period and subsides in 2 to 3 days<br>3. Dull, continuous ache<br>4. Pain that radiates to your lower back and thighs
           <h3>When to see a doctor</h3>See your health care provider if:<br>> Menstrual cramps disrupt your life every month<br>> Your symptoms progressively worsen<br>> You just started having severe menstrual cramps after age 25
           <h2>Menstrual cramps can be caused by:</h2><strong>Endometriosis:</strong> Tissue that acts similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, most commonly on fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining your pelvis.<br><strong>Uterine fibroids:</strong> These noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus can cause pain.<br><strong>Adenomyosis:</strong> The tissue that lines your uterus begins to grow into the muscular walls of the uterus.<br><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease:</strong> This infection of the female reproductive organs is usually caused by sexually transmitted bacteria.<br><strong>Cervical stenosis</strong> In some women, the opening of the cervix is small enough to impede menstrual flow, causing a painful increase of pressure within the uterus.

             <h2> Risk factors</h2>
             <p>You might be at risk of menstrual cramps if:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You're younger than age 30</li>
                <li>You started puberty early, at age 11 or younger</li>
                <li>You bleed heavily during periods (menorrhagia)</li>
                <li>You have irregular menstrual bleeding (metrorrhagia)</li>
                <li>You have a family history of menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)</li>
                <li>You smoke</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Complications</h2>
              <p>Menstrual cramps don't cause other medical complications, but they can interfere with school, work and social activities.<br><br>Certain conditions associated with menstrual cramps can have complications, though. For example, endometriosis can cause fertility problems. Pelvic inflammatory disease can scar your fallopian tubes, increasing the risk of a fertilized egg implanting outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy).

            <h2> Treatment</h2>To ease your menstrual cramps, your health care provider might recommend:<br>
            <p><strong>Pain relievers:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), at regular doses starting the day before you expect your period to begin can help control the pain of cramps. Prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also are available.<br>Start taking the pain reliever at the beginning of your period, or as soon as you feel symptoms, and continue taking the medicine as directed for two to three days, or until your symptoms are gone.<br>
            <p><strong>Hormonal birth control: </strong> Oral birth control pills contain hormones that prevent ovulation and reduce the severity of menstrual cramps. These hormones can also be delivered in several other forms: an injection, a skin patch, an implant placed under the skin of your arm, a flexible ring that you insert into your vagina, or an intrauterine device (IUD).<br>
            <p><strong>Surgery: </strong> If your menstrual cramps are caused by a disorder such as endometriosis or fibroids, surgery to correct the problem might help your symptoms. Surgical removal of the uterus also might be an option if other approaches fail to ease your symptoms and if you're not planning to have children.
